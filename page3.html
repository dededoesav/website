                <p2> I was first brought onto to collaborate with Plaster Cast on their verbatim show <i>Sound Cistem</i> at <a href="https://www.niamos.co.uk/"> Niamos <a> for the event <i>Stream Econ.</i> <br>
                    Since then, the show with visuals has toured across the UK, performing at the Brighton fringe, Brainchild Festival and Pleasance in London. <br>
                    I am currently in R&D for <i> Delicious Fruits</i>, a new verbatim piece that will be performed alongside <i> Sound Cistem</i> with Pleasance Theatre at the Edinburgh Fringe throughout August.
